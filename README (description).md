## Step 1: Flask-Based RESTful API:
- Ensure and install Flask into the environment being used, in this case Google Shell
- Then in that environment create the code for your ```app.py``` file within the project directory
- After creating the app.py file and integrating GET requests into the code, ran the app locally
-   add pics
-   By changing and adding the argument ```?name=_____``` in this case added mine, it displayed into the flask app locally.
-   By doing so we can also test different endpoints that we included in the app.py file just by adding the argument at the end of the URL and navigating to the other endpoint
-   add pic "hello from another page"

-
